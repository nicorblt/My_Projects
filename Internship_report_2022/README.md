# Internship in a fundamental mathematics laboratory - Institut Fourier, Universit√© Grenoble Alpes / CNRS

During this internship I worked in collaboration with a researcher on the study of partial differential equations. During this internship I produced a scientific document for educational purposes.

If you want to have the source code of the pdf, send me a mail!
