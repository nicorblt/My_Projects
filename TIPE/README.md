# Study of the optimisation of the decongestion of a crowd - TIPE

Project carried out throughout the MPSI/MP preparatory class.

The objective was to create a mathematical model of the dynamics of a crowd in order to simulate its movement. 
The aim of these models was to observe how to optimize the evacuation of the crowd through the study of the variations of various parameters.

This project allowed me to obtain a mark of 14/20 in the competitive examination of the engineering schools.
