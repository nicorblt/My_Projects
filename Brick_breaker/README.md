Java project carried out in the final year of high school as part of the Computer Science and Digital Science option, this was my first IT project.

This work was done in team with Arnaud Sadion.

Unfortunately the project code has been lost.

Remark : If you want to see the videos in the presentation just download it, there are clickable links.
